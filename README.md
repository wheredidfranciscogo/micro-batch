# micro-batch

## Overview

In this project, I'm simulating the assembly of robots using a series of classes and functions. The goal is to implement a micro-batching system where individual tasks, represented as components needed to assemble a robot, are grouped together and processed in batches. Upon completion of each batch, a special number is assigned to the assembled robot.

### Components

  Job: Represents individual tasks in the assembly process.
  JobResult: Represents the result of a job, including data and error information.
  RobotComponent: Represents a component needed to assemble a robot.
  Robot: Represents a fully assembled robot, consisting of components.
  RobotBuilder: Manages the assembly process, batching components together, and assigning special numbers to assembled robots.
